Page Description:
The Coding Academy Pricing Plans page showcases different subscription tiers with their respective features and pricing. The design aims for a clean, organized layout providing users with a clear understanding of each plan's offerings.

About the Styling:
Color Scheme: The background blends light blue and light green to create a pleasing and professional look.
Header: The title "Coding Academy Pricing Plans" is highlighted in a bold gradient background transitioning from blue to a darker shade, making it easy to notice. White text improves readability against this background.
Box Styling: Each pricing option appears in a box with a light blue background, a subtle shadow, and rounded corners. When you hover over them, they slightly grow larger and gain a noticeable shadow to show they're interactive.
Features Section: Plan features are listed as bullet points using Font Awesome icons (fa-check-square) for a more appealing and clear visual. Initially hidden, they expand when a box is clicked, making it easier to navigate and preventing overwhelming users with too much information at once.

Dropdown Selection: Users can pick their currency from a dropdown, which instantly adjusts the prices to their chosen currency (USD or INR).
Box Interaction: Clicking a box expands its content, neatly organizing details and making it easier to understand. Using JavaScript and CSS, the challenge was to toggle the visibility of this content when boxes are clicked.
Responsiveness: The page layout adapts to various screen sizes and devices, ensuring everyone gets an optimal view without any layout issues.
